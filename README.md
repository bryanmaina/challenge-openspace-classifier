# Challenge: Open Space Classifier

A small utility that reads a CSV of people and randomly assigns them to seats at tables. It can be run daily with a path to your CSV and will output a summary of how many people were seated and who couldn't be seated if capacity is exceeded.

## Features
- Accepts file paths as strings or pathlib.Path
- Reads names from a CSV column named "Names"
- If your CSV is a single column without a header, it will automatically create a clean_ file with a header and re-read it
- Randomly distributes people across tables and seats
- Default room capacity: 6 tables Ã— 4 seats = 24 seats

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- [Install uv on your system.](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

## CSV format
- Preferred: a header row with a column named Names
  - Example:
    Names
    Alice
    Bob
    Charlie
- Also supported: a single-column CSV without a header (the program will create clean_<filename> with a Names header and use that)

## Running the app
You can pass the CSV path as an argument or run interactively.

- With an argument:
```cmd
uv run challenge-openspace-classifier path\to\your\people.csv
```

- Interactively (you will be prompted for the path):
```cmd
uv run challenge-openspace-classifier
```

Example data file in this repo: data\new_colleagues.csv (single-column list without header)

## Output
The program prints a summary like:

- Total names: N | Seated: S | Unseated: U
- If any people could not be seated, their names are listed under "Unseated people"

## Notes on capacity
- Defaults to 6 tables with 4 seats each (24 total)
- People are shuffled and seated table-by-table until no seats remain
- Any extra names are returned and printed as "Unseated"

## Development

### Formatting the code
```cmd
uv tool run black .
```

### Test and Test Coverage
Run tests with verbose mode (-v) and test coverage:
```cmd
uv run pytest -v
```

Run test coverage and report with line numbers:
```cmd
uv run pytest --cov=challenge_openspace_classifier --cov-report=term-missing
```
